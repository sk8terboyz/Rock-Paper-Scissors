# Rock Paper Scissors

Author: Shane Kennedy

## Basic Information:
This Rock Paper Scissors game was created for the purposes of refreshing myself with tkinter and Python development. The code is relatively straight-forward and the comments should explain the code itself well enough.

## Images/Code
Although I did write all of this code, I made use of a tutorial in order to understand the common practices of tkinter and how it works. I personally created the default "Mickey Mouse" fists and scissor images by tracing in Photoshop while the rock and paper images were found via Google Search.
